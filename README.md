The "Fake News Classifier | Python, ML Algorithms, NLP" is a machine learning tool that uses a Random Forest Classifier to determine whether news articles are reliable or not. The tool employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess unfiltered data, which helps to achieve higher accuracy in detecting fake news.

To begin, the tool analyzes the text of news articles and extracts relevant features using NLP techniques, such as tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal. These features are then used to train a Random Forest Classifier algorithm, which learns to distinguish between real and fake news articles based on a dataset of labeled examples.

The "Fake News Classifier" tool is designed to be highly customizable, allowing users to modify the parameters and features used to suit their specific needs. It also includes a user-friendly interface that enables users to input news articles for analysis and view the results.

Overall, the "Fake News Classifier | Python, ML Algorithms, NLP" is an effective tool for identifying and filtering out fake news articles. With its sophisticated machine learning algorithms and powerful NLP capabilities, it offers a reliable solution for distinguishing between reliable and unreliable news sources.
